## Multi-Agent Knowledge Mesh Validation

**Status:** ✅ PASSED  
**Date:** 2026-02-13  
**Duration:** ~30 minutes  
**Agents:** Neuromancer (VPS), Clawdy (Tatooine)

## Test Objective

Validate the Multi-Agent Knowledge Mesh protocol with a real strategic decision: Should DSE AI invest in fine-tuning LLMs or optimize prompt engineering in 2025?

---

## The Question

> "Should DSE AI invest in fine-tuning LLMs for 2025, or optimize prompt engineering? Cost/benefit/risk analysis required."

## Parallel Research

### [RESEARCH-VPS] Neuromancer

**Angle:** External market trends, vendor pricing, cost analysis, ROI data

**Key Findings:**
- Fine-tuning costs: $300-5,000 (LoRA) vs $35,000+ (full)
- Prompt engineering: Near-zero upfront, $4-180 per task
- Break-even: >10,000 queries/day for fine-tuning
- 54% of enterprises use hybrid approaches
- 70% start with prompts for validation

### [RESEARCH-TATOOINE] Clawdy

**Angle:** Vision-ARI guidance, S&P policy, prior decisions, resource constraints

**Key Findings:**
- Vision-ADR 012: "Prompt engineering first, fine-tune with measurable evidence"
- MI Big Rules #2, #8, #9 create governance overhead for fine-tuning
- Mitko's current setup already cost-optimized (Kimi free, Codex)
- Rollback complexity favors prompt agility

## Unified Recommendation

**DSE AI should optimize prompt engineering aggressively in 2025, deferring fine-tuning until four conditions are met:**

1. >90% accuracy required
2. >10,000 queries/day sustained
3. Quality training data ready (1,000+ labeled examples)
4. ROI case approved per MI Big Rule #2

### Immediate Actions (30 Days)
1. Baseline current prompt accuracy (target: 85%)
2. Implement prompt caching per Vision-ADR 012
3. Document advanced prompt patterns for reuse

### Short-Term (3-6 Months)
4. Collect performance data (accuracy, cost, latency)
5. Evaluate at 6 months for fine-tuning readiness

### Conditional (6+ Months)
6. Fine-tuning ONLY if all four conditions met
